Update 4.0
Someone on MPD thought that the storage sysstem iss unbalaanced rn, so I added iron chests restocked and a simple storage mod for those who dont like pretty pipes! Keep up the good work on playing this pack and I love you guys!

Other Updates:
The release of the modpack, nothing to say... If you find any bugs PLEASE contact me at @dominiclove (add me as friend on discord), or dm me if I am at your server! Special thanks to the MPD discord who guided and motivated me the way through...
